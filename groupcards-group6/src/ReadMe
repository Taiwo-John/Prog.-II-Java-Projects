Hello,

  As a Group, I was focusing on the logic and key element we need in our code that we need to have
  in order meet the requirements of the assignment. This requires a bit of research and a lot of thinking,
  The most challenge we face as a group is to fix some bug in case something don't work as expected.
  This is the point where everyone's contribution comes in and brainstorm how to fix a bug.

  Thank you!
